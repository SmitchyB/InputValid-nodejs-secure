# InputValid-nodejs-secure
This repo contains an unsecure Node.js (Express) sign-up app. Part of Master's research, it demonstrates severe input validation vulnerabilities by accepting all user inputs (username, email, phone, password) without any checks or sanitization. It's a baseline for empirical testing, allowing exploitation to evaluate SAST tool detection of flaws.
